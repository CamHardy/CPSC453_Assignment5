Um, so I had a problem with the moon orbit, it works fine if the earth is stationary, but if the earth is travelling around its orbit then the moon orbit becomes elliptical. I have no idea why, I spent oodles of time trying to fix it but no luck. So yeah, the moon orbit is very elliptical PLS DON'T BE MAD.
